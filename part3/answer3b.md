## 1. Linting
- Linting ensures code style consistency and catches syntax or formatting issues early.
# Steps:
- Choose a linter for your language:
  - Python → flake8, pylint, black (formatter)
  - JavaScript/TypeScript → eslint, prettier
  - Go → golint, go vet
- Create a GitHub Actions job:
  - see answer3bjob.yaml
