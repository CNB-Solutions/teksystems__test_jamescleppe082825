Answers to Question 1a and 1b, part 1

---

## ðŸ”¹ 1. Application Layer (ASP.NET)

* **SQL Injection** â€“ If queries are built with string concatenation instead of parameterized queries, attackers can exfiltrate or modify MySQL data.
* **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** â€“ Unsanitized user input rendered in pages allows injection of malicious JavaScript.
* **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)** â€“ Lack of anti-forgery tokens allows attackers to perform actions on behalf of authenticated users.
* **Authentication & Session Hijacking**

  * Weak password policies or lack of MFA.
  * Session IDs stored in predictable cookies or over unencrypted HTTP.
* **Insecure File Uploads** â€“ Uploading malicious files (e.g., `.aspx` shells or executables) if validation is weak.
* **Deserialization Attacks** â€“ ASP.NET apps that deserialize untrusted input are at risk of remote code execution (RCE).
* **Configuration Disclosure** â€“ Web.config leaks (via misconfigured IIS) may expose connection strings and secrets.

## ðŸ”¹ 2. Web Server Layer (IIS on Windows Server 2022)

* **Default/Weak IIS Configuration** â€“ Directory browsing, verbose error messages, trace.axd exposed.
* **Misconfigured Request Filtering** â€“ Allows dangerous verbs (PUT, DELETE, TRACE).
* **IIS Module Exploits** â€“ Vulnerable or outdated IIS modules/extensions could be abused.
* **Weak TLS/SSL** â€“ Using outdated protocols (e.g., TLS 1.0/1.1), weak ciphers, or self-signed certificates.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 3. Database Layer (MySQL on Windows)

* **Weak MySQL Authentication** â€“ Default accounts, weak passwords, or no SSL between app and DB.
* **Privilege Escalation** â€“ Application accounts with `root`-level access instead of least privilege.
* **SQL Injection Amplification** â€“ Poor logging/monitoring may let attackers pivot inside DB.
* **MySQL Service Exposure** â€“ If MySQL is listening on external interfaces, itâ€™s vulnerable to brute force or exploit attempts.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 4. Operating System (Windows Server 2022)

* **Unpatched Vulnerabilities** â€“ Attackers exploiting Windows kernel, RDP, or IIS-related CVEs.
* **Privilege Escalation** â€“ Misconfigured service permissions or weak local admin accounts.
* **Credential Dumping** â€“ Using tools like Mimikatz to steal stored credentials.
* **Unnecessary Services** â€“ Enabled SMB, RDP, or FTP services that widen the attack surface.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 5. Network & Perimeter

* **RDP Brute Force / Exposed Management Interfaces** â€“ If RDP or WinRM is publicly accessible.
* **DDoS Attacks** â€“ Flooding IIS or exhausting resources.
* **Weak Firewall Rules** â€“ Allowing traffic from anywhere to MySQL or IIS.
* **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks** â€“ If TLS isnâ€™t enforced end-to-end.
